## About Me:
My mental construct has been weaned on lifelong learning and continuous development. I have been performing in the software and information industry at apprentice and proficient levels in various grades and roles since 2011.

I am laboriously interested in creating and advancing custom-built software projects for clients, which commonly concerns designing and analyzing them from the ground up.

Currently, I am serving as a “Software Development Team Leader / Full Stack Software Engineer” at companies by the name of Beyes and Metacone.

Some of the actions and assignments that I contributed to a great extent to for these related companies / organizations are as follows:

- Created and developed CMS applications connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), tailored to meet the specific needs of digital transformation.

- Concocted and enhanced projects’ UI/UX and frontend aspects during their design and development phases.

- Involved in the research and development phases of WEB3, Blockchain, Coin Wallet, and dApp-integrated systems that run on the Solana infrastructure.

- Took part in decision-making roles in the software team and project management processes.
